# Agent contract

This file is binding for every agent session in this repo, regardless of tool or model.

## Project identity

This repository hosts the `SubZeroDev.com` site. It consumes the `SubZeroDev.Platform.UI.LandingPage` package for its UI and carries its own site-level configuration on top of it — it does not own or fork the landing-page UI itself. Companion repository: `SubZeroDev.Platform.UI.LandingPage`.

## Source of truth

The design docs outrank the code. In precedence order:

1. `design/00-brief.md` — problem, non-goals, definition of done
2. `design/20-contract.md` — types, schemas, signatures, error semantics
3. `design/10-design.md` — architecture, data model, failure modes
4. `design/30-slices.md` — work breakdown and acceptance criteria
5. `design/90-decisions.md` — append-only decision log

If the code contradicts the contract, that is a defect in one of them. **Stop and say which one you think is wrong. Do not silently reconcile.**

Lessons learned the hard way live in [`agent.md`](agent.md) — read it after this file.

## Safe start

Before editing anything:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
git branch --show-current
git log -5 --oneline
rg --files
```

- Discover files and tooling rather than assuming they exist.
- Read this file and the sources you are about to change **completely**. Editing from memory, or from a diff, is the most common cause of drift.
- Preserve unrelated and uncommitted work. Never stage, reset, clean, or overwrite it.
- Work on a focused branch.
- Where guidance conflicts, follow the most specific applicable instruction.

## Model, effort, and review budget

**Model choice follows task complexity. The command being invoked does not determine the model.** Budget scales with **complexity, not size** — a one-line change to an invariant is architectural; a 500-line transcription against a settled contract is not.

Name model *families*, never pinned versions. Version identifiers churn; family aliases do not.

| Tier | Work | Effort | Claude | Codex |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Deep reasoning** | Brief interrogation, architecture, contracts, slice planning, security, concurrency, recovery, root-cause analysis, adjudicating design findings | `high` | `opus` | `architect` |
| **Exceptional fork** | One specific architectural or security question that stayed ambiguous at `high` | `xhigh` | `opus` | `architect` |
| **Implementation** | Code against a settled contract, tests, refactors, bug fixes, CI, infrastructure, implementation-coupled documentation | `medium`, `high` when difficult | `sonnet` | `builder` |
| **High volume** | Summaries, formatting, changelogs, commit messages, PR descriptions, mechanical triage | `low` | `haiku` | `quick` |

- **Never use `max` effort unless I ask for it by name.**
- **`xhigh` is for one question, not one pipeline.** Running a whole design phase at `xhigh` is not rigour, it is a substitute for asking a precise question.
- **Escalate rather than guess.** A high-volume task that raises an implementation question becomes implementation tier; an implementation task that raises an architectural question becomes deep reasoning. **Do not keep implementing while that uncertainty is unresolved.**
- **Open substantive work with a banner, then gate on it.** Before starting anything beyond a trivial lookup, state what the work is (task or command, plus slice id if applicable) and the tier it requires per *Command routing* or the table above. **It is a heading, not a sentence** — three plain lines fenced above and below by a rule of `=`, labels and tier names in Title Case, never folded into a paragraph. For example:

  ```
  ===============================
  Work: /design — write design/10-design.md
  Tier: Deep Reasoning → opus/high
  Session: opus
  ===============================
  ```

  Then check the session's actual model against the required family. If it matches or exceeds it, proceed without further comment. If the session is under-powered for the tier, **stop before doing any expensive work**, name the model and effort actually needed, and wait — do not proceed on the wrong model unless the user explicitly overrides after seeing the mismatch. If the session is *stronger* than required, just proceed — do not interrupt to say so.

**Division of control.** I set the session model. You set subagent models and scale your own reasoning depth. You cannot change your own session model.

### Command routing

| Command | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/brief-check`, `/design`, `/contract`, `/slices` | `opus`, `high` | — |
| `/redteam` | strongest model, **different vendor from the design author** | If it must be Claude, a fresh `opus`, `high` session |
| `/slice` | `sonnet`, `medium` | `high` for a large or difficult slice |
| `/reconcile` | `opus`, `high` to decide which side of a drift is correct | `sonnet`, `medium` for the mechanical edits once I have decided |
| `/make-human-docs` | `sonnet`, `medium` | Escalate only if the design turns out to be ambiguous — then stop, do not resolve it in prose |
| `/track` | `sonnet`, `medium` | Mechanical sync; escalate only to judge whether a drifted slice is a design change |
| `/verify` | `sonnet`, `medium` | Escalate to deep reasoning only to diagnose a failure, never to run the gates |
| `/pr` | `sonnet`, `medium` | — |
| `/resolve` | `sonnet`, `medium` | Escalate to judge a contested finding, not to triage the obvious ones |
| `/fix` | `sonnet`, `medium` | Escalate only where the fix turns out to need a contract, schema, or public-interface change — that is `/contract`'s or `/design`'s, and this command stops rather than absorbing it |
| `/refine` | `sonnet`, `medium` | Never escalates — an architectural ask is routed to the command that owns it, not refined |
| `/install` | `sonnet`, `medium` | — |
| `/install-all` | `sonnet`, `medium` | Escalate only to judge whether a per-repo hard stop is actually safe to resolve — never to resolve it unattended |
| `/kit-help` | `haiku`, `low` | Orientation from file existence and a tracker listing. Escalate only where the repository's state matches no stage |

**Never recommend re-running a phase gate.** I decide when a phase repeats. This holds outside `/redteam` too — see that command for its own stopping rule.

### Session boundaries

Routing says which model runs a command. This says **when a session must end.** A boundary exists wherever carrying context would corrupt the next step's judgement, or wherever the next step must read the tree rather than remember it. **The artifact is the handoff, not the conversation** — a stage that writes one has already handed over everything the next stage is entitled to.

| Boundary | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `/design` → `/redteam` | **Fresh session, and a different vendor.** | A model recognises its own output distribution and defends it. Fresh context on the same model is already the weak form; the same session is not a review at all. |
| Any stage that writes an artifact → the next | Fresh. | The next stage's input is the committed file. A session that also remembers the arguments behind it will design against the arguments. |
| `/slices` → `/slice` | Fresh, and **one slice per session**. | A slice that does not fit one session without compaction is too large — that is a `/slices` defect, so say so rather than pressing on. |
| `/slice` → `/verify` → `/pr` → `/resolve` | **Same session.** | These act on the branch and worktree the slice just produced, and `/pr` must carry `/verify`'s did-not-run list into the description **verbatim**. A fresh session would restate it from a summary, which is the fabricated gate result *Verification* exists to prevent. |
| `/fix` → `/verify` → `/pr` → `/resolve` | **Same session.** | Same reason as the slice loop above: these act on the branch and worktree `/fix` just produced, and the did-not-run list must be carried verbatim rather than restated from a summary. |
| merge → `/track` | Fresh. | `/track` reads the tracker and `design/` as they now stand. The session that just implemented the slice holds an opinion about whether it is done, and doneness is my mark, not an agent's. |
| implementation → `/reconcile` | Fresh. | It compares the tree against the docs. The session that wrote the code carries what it *intended* to write, which is the one thing the comparison must not be given. |

**Compaction is a boundary you did not choose.** If a session compacts mid-slice, report it — the slice was mis-sized, and the work after the compaction was done against a summary of the contract rather than the contract.

**End a response that lands on a fresh-session boundary with a banner, not a footnote.** A boundary buried in the last sentence of a report gets carried into the next reply of the same session out of habit, which is the exact failure the boundary exists to prevent. Set it off as a heading in the same form as the [work-start banner](#model-effort-and-review-budget) — `=` rules, Title Case, plain lines — naming: the boundary just crossed, the next command, and its tier from *Command routing*. For example:

```
===============================
Session Boundary — Do Not Carry Into /track
Next: /track, Fresh Session, sonnet/medium
===============================
```

Do not run the next command yourself. Ending a session may be the next step, and a command that starts work cannot also tell the user to start a new one for it — that restriction is unchanged, only how visibly the handoff is stated.

### Budget discipline

- **Do not spend reasoning to manufacture findings, alternatives, or open questions.** A short honest answer beats a padded one; "none at this level" is a valid result.
- **Once a policy decision is signed off and recorded, do not relitigate it** without new evidence. Name the evidence if you think there is some.
- **Spend frontier-model reasoning on decisions that are expensive to reverse**, not on producing more prose.

### What should stop being model work

Routing decides *which* model does a job. This decides whether a model should be doing it at all.

| | Work | Where it belongs |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Necessary** | Architecture, contracts, root-cause analysis, design tradeoffs, adjudicating findings | A model, at the tier above |
| 🟡 **Maybe avoidable** | Regenerating context already established, duplicate repository scans, rewriting boilerplate | A model, but the repetition is a signal — say so |
| 🔴 **Definitely avoidable** | Formatting, mechanical text transformation, arithmetic over files, counting, collecting metrics | Code. It should leave the model entirely |

**A red item is a defect in the tooling, not in the run.** Noticing one is worth a line; performing it repeatedly and never saying so is the failure. When a red item recurs, put it in `## Open` in `design/90-decisions.md` so `/track` can turn it into an issue — that is the existing path, and there is no separate mechanism for this.

Two distinctions that are easy to get wrong:

- **The mechanical half of a task is red; the judgement half is not.** Opening an issue is an API call, but deciding what warrants one is not. Writing a PR description is a template, but which merge convention governs is not — `/pr` exists because that half is real. Do not classify a whole command by its cheapest step.
- **Do not report a cost you did not measure.** A model is not given its own token counts or elapsed time, so any figure it states about its own run is an estimate presented as a measurement. `tools/Measure-Session.ps1` reads the real per-call usage from the session transcript. Use it, or say nothing. It measures **Claude Code sessions only** — Codex writes a different schema this has no reader for, and Copilot records no token usage at all. Under either, *say nothing* is the whole instruction.

## Hard rules

- **Non-goals are binding.** Anything listed as a non-goal in the brief is out of scope even if it looks trivial, even if you are already touching that file.
- **One slice at a time.** Do not start slice N+1 because you noticed something while doing slice N. Write it to `90-decisions.md` under `## Open` instead.
- **No new dependencies** without a decision-log entry naming the alternatives rejected and why.
- **No new public interfaces** that are not in `20-contract.md`. If you need one, stop and ask for a contract amendment.
- **Ask instead of assuming.** If two readings of the spec are both defensible, stop and present both. Do not pick one and proceed.
- **Every slice ends runnable.** No half-wired states committed.

## Single ownership

- **Reference, never restate.** A rule that lives in another document is linked, not copied. Two copies of a rule is a promise they will diverge and a guarantee nobody notices which is stale.
- **Move, never copy.** A rule has exactly one home. When it belongs somewhere else, move it and leave a reference behind.
- If a document genuinely must repeat something to stand on its own, name the canonical copy in the text and change both in the same commit. Naming a canonical copy is what makes the others checkable.
- **The test for where a decision belongs:** would a second consumer face this same question? If yes it belongs in the shared document, even while only one consumer exercises it. Where it is genuinely unclear, the shared document is the safer home — a rule that turns out to be specific is easy to relax later; a rule discovered to be shared after three consumers each answered it differently is a migration.

## Verification

- **Verify, don't assert.** State only what you have checked. Assert nothing from memory that a command could confirm — remembered values and inferred contracts are how wrong facts get written down confidently.
- **Do not claim a gate passed that did not run.** If a tool is unavailable, say so plainly and name what was not checked. "Tests pass" means you ran them and read the output. `/verify` exists to make this checkable rather than aspirational — its report has three lists, and the one that matters is *what did not run*.
- **Never state or imply a deployed URL or a published artifact** until the deploy for that exact commit reports success. A merged PR is not a deployed site. Poll; do not estimate.
- **A regression test is verified by reverting the fix** and confirming it fails. A test that passes with and without the fix guards nothing.
- **A schema or validator change is not done until it has rejected something.** Positive and negative cases both, with the counts stated. A validator that has never failed is not known to constrain anything.

## Working with me

- Present findings and review items **one at a time for sign-off**. Never bulk-apply findings unreviewed.
- Surface real forks as a question with a recommendation, recommended option first. I routinely pick the more rigorous non-recommended option — so ask, do not assume.
- **A reconciliation ends in a decision, not a report.** Any time you compare two things and find they disagree — `/reconcile`, `/install`, `/track` drift, or any time I say "reconcile" — the work is not finished at the findings. Close by asking, one divergence at a time, each with a recommendation and what the alternatives cost. **A report I have to turn into questions myself is half the job.** If a comparison genuinely found nothing, say that plainly rather than manufacturing a fork.
  - Recommend the **resolution**, not merely which side you prefer: name what changes, in which file, and what it costs to reverse.
  - `/redteam` is the one exception, and only partly — it must not propose fixes, since naming a fix frames the problem. It still recommends a **classification** for each finding: defect, accepted risk, brief conflict, or not sustained.
- When I decline a suggestion, record it in the affected document as known-and-retained rather than dropping it silently. Otherwise it is rediscovered later as a bug.
- Ask before any choice that sets policy or a public contract: licensing, compatibility promises, a major information-architecture change.
- Call out assumptions, unverified claims, and known risks plainly. Explain the concrete evidence behind a recommendation.

## Git and delivery

- **Stage explicitly, by named path.** Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, or a bare directory. A broad add sweeps up unrelated worktree state, and an ignore pattern can make a needed file invisible to it — present locally, green locally, missing in CI, with nothing saying why.
- Run `git diff --check` before committing. Never use trailing double-spaces for a line break; it rejects them.
- **Never force-push or rewrite published history.** If a pushed commit needs changing, add a follow-up commit.
- **Push every commit before announcing a PR is ready.** Announcing invites an immediate merge, and a commit pushed after that lands on a branch nobody merges.
- External writes need my authorization: creating a remote repository, changing visibility, pushing, opening or merging pull requests, changing a domain, deploying. **Discussing a decision does not authorize it.** Three carve-outs: GitHub issue, milestone, and project writes (*Tracking work*), `/slice` pushing the branch it just created and opening the PR it starts **as a draft** (`.claude/commands/slice.md`), and `/fix` doing the same for the branch and draft PR its own fix produces (`.claude/commands/fix.md`). A draft blocks no one and requests no review, so opening one carries the same reversibility argument as opening an issue. Marking that PR ready for review, and merging it, are not carved out and stay `/pr`'s and the user's respectively.
- Do not delete files, branches, or history without explicit authorization.
- Check review **threads**, not just requested reviewers — an automated reviewer can leave blocking conversation threads that do not appear in a reviewer listing. Resolve a thread only when a validated fix satisfies it; leave ambiguous findings open and report them. `/resolve` does this; the query it needs is written out there.
- **Resolving or replying to a review thread is not carved out.** The exceptions in *Tracking work* cover issue, milestone, and project writes; a pull request's review threads are a different object and stay authorized regardless — except through the resolution batch below. Where a repository delegates resolution explicitly, follow its wording; where it is silent, ask.
- **The resolution batch is the one exception to per-action authorization for review threads.** Where `/resolve` (`.claude/commands/resolve.md`) has finished classifying every thread on a pull request first, one approval can cover the push, the pull request update, and resolving the exact threads named when that approval was requested. A batch authorizes exactly the thread ids enumerated at the moment it was granted, and no others (**I3**) — a thread that surfaces afterwards, including from a fresh bot review, needs its own ask. A batch does not outlive the response that acts on it (**I4**); it is not a standing authorization for the rest of the session. **The batch is unavailable in a repository I do not own — every action in it is requested individually there**, the same boundary every carve-out in *Tracking work* stops at (**I9**). The five classes, and what happens to each, stay owned by `resolve.md`.

## Tracking work

**Defer work to the tracker rather than processing it inline.** A finding, a follow-up, or a defect noticed in passing goes to a GitHub issue — not into a running list in the conversation, and not into a section of a document that will rot. Prose is where work goes to be forgotten.

- **Opening, labelling, closing, commenting on, and editing an issue is carved out of the authorization rule**, in a repository I own — including one opened by someone else. Issues are cheap and reversible, which is the entire justification.
- **Milestones and projects are carved out too**, in a repository I own. Creating one no longer needs approval; deleting one still does, since that direction is not cheaply reversible.
- **Writing to a repository I do not own is never carved out.** That boundary is the one this section does not relax.
- **`/track` owns every GitHub write it can make idempotent.** No other command creates issues, milestones, or projects. It is idempotent, so run it often rather than batching. Closing an issue and ticking a checkbox are the exceptions — the command that observes the work done does those directly, in the same run, rather than waiting for a sync pass.
- `design/30-slices.md` stays authoritative for what a slice *is*; its issue tracks whether it is *done*. If the two come to describe the work differently, say so rather than editing either.
- The `## Open` section of `design/90-decisions.md` is a staging area, not a home. Once an item becomes an issue, remove it from there.
- **Every issue reads human-first.** A narrative anyone can follow, then `### Done when` checkboxes, then the agent detail in a collapsed `<details>` block.
- **The agent block is fenced** by `<!-- agent:start -->` and `<!-- agent:end -->`. Inside the fence is regenerable; **outside it, a regenerating command never rewrites anything** — an edited narrative is someone's deliberate wording, and a stale copy gets fixed by hand, not overwritten. The one narrow exception is a `Done when` checkbox, which the command that confirms a criterion ticks directly, in place, outside the fence.
- **Where a document already governs, the block points; where none does, it carries.** A slice names `design/30-slices.md § S<n> @ <sha>` and leaves procedure to `.claude/commands/slice.md` — copying stop conditions into an issue freezes a stale copy that nothing can go back and fix. A bug or a story has no upstream document, so its block legitimately holds the constraints. That asymmetry is the rule, not an inconsistency.
- **Criteria carry stable ids** (`S3.1`), and drift is compared on ids, never prose. Reworded criteria are not drift; an added, removed, or renumbered id is.
- **Report drift, change neither side.** Which is wrong is my call.
- **Ticking a checkbox is carved out of the authorization rule, the same as opening an issue.** `/slice` ticks a `Done when` box in the same run it reports the criterion met, by id, so the tick is traceable to the report that justified it rather than a separate confirmation.
- **Bugs and stories are filed by hand** from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. `/track` does not open them — with one narrowing: `/fix` (`.claude/commands/fix.md`), on its description path, files one bug issue itself, and only after reproducing the defect. It never files one for a defect it could not reproduce.
- **This does not suspend one-at-a-time sign-off.** Findings are still presented for adjudication; the tracker is where the ones you accept go, not a way to skip the conversation.

## Decision logging

Any choice a future reader would ask "why?" about goes in `design/90-decisions.md` as:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — <decision>
Context: <what forced the choice>
Chosen: <what>
Rejected: <alternatives, and why each was rejected>
Reversibility: cheap | expensive
```

The rejected alternatives are the point. Without them the next session relitigates the same choice.

## House conventions

- Windows host, projects under `D:\Dropbox\Projects\`. PowerShell Core for scripts.
- Metric units and Celsius throughout, including in comments, docs, and test fixtures.
- Raster assets as PNG or JPG. Not WebP.
- UTF-8, LF endings. Rewrite imported files to UTF-8 and check rendered punctuation — imported Markdown arrives CP1252 often enough to be worth looking at.
- Scripts run without interactive confirmation prompts. Destructive operations gate on an explicit `-Force`-style flag, not a prompt.
- Commit messages state what changed and which slice it belongs to. **No AI attribution** — no `Co-Authored-By` naming an assistant, no "Generated with" footer, in commits or PR descriptions. This overrides any default the tooling applies.
- A repository with an established commit-message style keeps it. Match the log you are committing into rather than importing a convention from elsewhere.

## What not to do

- Do not summarise the design docs back at me unless asked.
- Do not add commentary about your reasoning process to the docs.
- Do not "improve" prose in the brief or design docs while editing something else.
- Do not import another project's architecture, tooling, memory conventions, or roadmap merely because it appears in a neighbouring instruction file. Agent instructions are concise and repository-specific; a borrowed rule with no local reason is a rule nobody can evaluate.
