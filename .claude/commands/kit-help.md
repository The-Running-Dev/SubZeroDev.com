description: Where this repository is in the pipeline, and what to run next. Usage - /kit-help, or /kit-help all

<!-- companion:declared:start -->
**Per-repo companion:** `.claude/commands/kit-help-local.md`. Read it now, if it exists — an absent,
empty, or frontmatter-only file is no companion, and this file then stands alone.
It may override: `vocabulary`, `document-map`. It may never override anything in
[`.claude/COMPANIONS.md`](../COMPANIONS.md) § *Never*, which is also where these categories are defined.
<!-- companion:declared:end -->

Orient the user in this repository's pipeline. **$1** narrows it — `all` shows the whole flow, a stage or command name shows that step. With nothing, work out where the repository actually is and show the current step and the next one.

**Do not dump this whole file back.** It is a map you read, not a message you echo. Reciting eleven steps to someone who needs the next one is the mechanical text work `AGENTS.md` says should not be a model's job at all — and here, unlike a script, you can tell which step they are on.

## Orient first

```powershell
Get-ChildItem design -Filter *.md -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name, Length
git branch --show-current
git log -3 --oneline
gh issue list --state all --limit 100 --json number,title,state 2>$null
```

Read it this way, and say which signal you used:

- **No `design/` at all** — the kit is installed but nothing has started. Stage 0.
- **`00-brief.md` only** — stage 1. An empty or near-empty file is not a brief; say so rather than counting it.
- **Each further doc present** — the stage after the last one written. `30-slices.md` present means stage 6.
- **On the default branch with slices written** — the next move is a branch, not a command.
- **The tracker** decides where inside stage 6 they are: no issues means `/track` has never run; an open issue with unticked boxes is the slice in flight.

State it in one line — *"stage 6, S4 open with S4.2 unticked, on `main`"* — then the step. If the evidence is genuinely ambiguous, say what you found and ask rather than picking.

## The flow

This is the canonical copy. `README.md` summarises the shape and points here.

**Which model runs each command is in `AGENTS.md`, *Command routing*. Where a session must end is in `AGENTS.md`, *Session boundaries*.** Both are binding policy with one home, and it is not this file — the `fresh` and `same session` tags below are a convenience, and if they ever disagree with `AGENTS.md`, that file is right and this one has drifted.

### Once per project — stages 0 to 5

Each is its own session. Every one ends in a committed file, and that file is what the next stage reads.

| # | Step | Session | Ends when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Write `design/00-brief.md` **yourself** | — | Problem, non-goals, definition of done, and a `Lifespan` line are all real |
| 1 | `/brief-check` | fresh | The four lists come back thin. It writes nothing — **you** edit the brief from them |
| 2 | `/design` | fresh | `10-design.md` has rejected alternatives in every section that needed a choice |
| 3 | `/redteam` | fresh, **different vendor** | One pass, adjudicated. Never ask for another |
| 4 | `/contract` | fresh | `20-contract.md` has no `## Unresolved` section left |
| 5 | `/slices` | fresh | The `Delivers:` lines read as a set, and no slice is too big for one session |
| — | `/track` | fresh | One issue per slice. Idempotent — run it whenever `design/` changes |

Stages 1 and 3 write nothing, so their output exists only in that session. Act on it before the session ends.

Three of these stop rather than proceed, and that is the cheapest failure available: `/design` stops if the brief is too thin, `/contract` stops on a signature the design does not determine, and `/redteam` produces findings but never a fix. Sending work back a stage costs a few thousand tokens; discovering it in stage 6 costs a re-implementation.

### Per slice — stage 6, on repeat

One slice, one branch, one session. Do not start slice N+1 because you noticed something in slice N — that goes in `90-decisions.md` under `## Open`, and `/track` turns it into an issue.

1. **`/slice S3`**, or bare **`/slice`** for the lowest-numbered slice that is neither closed nor fully ticked and whose dependencies are done. Branches, states criteria by id, writes failing tests first, implements against the contract, commits, pushes, opens the PR — **never as a draft** — ticks the `Done when` boxes it confirms, and ends by reporting the ids it believes are met.
2. **`/pr`** — same session, and the whole of the rest of the branch's life. Three phases in order: writes the real description onto the PR `/slice` opened; runs the gates and puts their three lists — the one that matters is *did not run* — into the `Verified` section **verbatim**, fixing nothing; then works the review threads automatically, fix → push → confirm checks on the **new** head → only then resolve. Resolving is delegated, no ask required (`AGENTS.md`, *Git and delivery*).
3. **Merge** — the user's, unless this repository's instruction file explicitly delegates it.
4. **`/track`** — **new session**, after the merge. Closes the issue if every box is ticked.
5. **`/done`** — any time after the merge. Switches back to the default branch, deletes the now-merged local slice branch (and any other local branch already merged), and prunes remote-tracking refs for branches gone from `origin`. Optional housekeeping, not a pipeline step — nothing downstream depends on it.

`/verify` and `/resolve` are phases 2 and 3 of `/pr` and own their own procedure; both stay callable on their own when you want the gates run against a tree, or threads worked on a PR `/pr` did not open.

**`/kit-sync`** — any time, in a repository the kit is already installed in. Updates the shared `~/.agent-kit` checkout and re-runs `INSTALL.md`'s reconciliation against this repository, so upgrading the kit itself never depends on someone having it checked out at a path you happen to know.

Then back to 1 for the next slice.

### Outside the slice loop — a defect with no slice

**`/fix`** — reproduces a defect first, then gets to a bug issue (given a number, or filing one from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md` after reproducing on the description path), branches, fixes, opens the PR, and hands off to the same `/pr`, same session throughout. Use it instead of `/slice` when the work has no slice id and no contract signature to implement against.

### When the slices run out

- **`/reconcile`** — fresh session. Reports contract drift, design drift, undocumented decisions, invalidated assumptions, and proposed `agent.md` lessons; the user decides each direction and it applies the edits after. This is the step that stops the docs becoming fiction.
- **`/make-human-docs`** — generates the guide from the design docs. Never hand-edit the result; `/reconcile` checks it for semantic drift.

### If the ask fits none of that

**`/refine`.** Every other command assumes you are already inside the pipeline. It routes the ask to the command that owns it where one exists, and otherwise emits a prompt carrying the constraints that bind it — for the user to run at the tier it names.

### Skipping most of it

For something short-lived, the honest minimum is `00-brief.md` with real non-goals, `20-contract.md`, and `/slice`. Skip 1, 2, 3, 7, 8. The `Lifespan` line in the brief exists to force that call before the work starts rather than after.

## Answering

- **Name the next command, its tier from `AGENTS.md`, and whether it needs a fresh session.** That is the whole answer most of the time.
- **Where it needs a fresh session, say so as the banner defined in `AGENTS.md`, *Session boundaries*** — set off visibly, not folded into the same sentence as the orientation line. This is the one command whose entire job is telling the user what's next, so it is the last place that banner should be easy to miss.
- **Do not run the next command.** This orients; it does not act. Ending a session may be the next step, and a command that starts work cannot tell the user to start a new session for it.
- **Do not invent a step, a stage, or a tier.** If something here does not cover the situation, say so — an invented step in a help command is the one that gets followed.

## Re-run

Stateless and safe to run any time, including back to back. It writes nothing and remembers
nothing between runs — every orientation is re-derived from `design/`, the current branch, and
the tracker as they stand at the moment it runs, so the answer can legitimately change between
two calls in the same conversation if something else moved the tree in between.
