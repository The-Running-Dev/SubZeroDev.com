description: Sync design/ into GitHub issues and milestones. Idempotent - safe to re-run.
argument-hint: [milestone name]
---

Reconcile `design/` against this repository's GitHub tracker. This command is the kit's single home for GitHub writes, and the authorization carve-out that permits them is in `AGENTS.md`, *Tracking work* — read it before writing anything.

Re-running must be a no-op when nothing has changed. That is the property that makes this safe to run often, and it is the first thing to get right.

## Before anything

```powershell
gh auth status
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,owner,hasIssuesEnabled,viewerPermission
```

- **Only write to a repository the user owns** and has push permission on. Stop otherwise.
- If issues are disabled, stop and say so.
- If the remote is not the repository you think it is, stop.

## Issue body — human first, agent detail second

Every issue this command writes has the same two parts, in this order.

1. **A narrative a human reads.** Two or three sentences: what someone can do afterwards that they cannot do now, and why it matters. No implementation vocabulary, no file paths, no type names.
2. **`### Done when`** — the acceptance criteria as checkboxes. These are the tracking surface; a pointer cannot be ticked off.
3. **A collapsed `<details>` block** holding the agent detail.

```markdown
**S3 — Host registration, heartbeat, and the split-brain surface**

A caller can register a host, watch it heartbeat, and see when two hosts claim
the same identity.

### Done when
- [ ] **S3.1** `RegisterAsync` returns `AlreadyRegistered` and leaves the record untouched when the id exists
- [ ] **S3.2** A missed heartbeat window marks the host `Stale` within one interval

<details><summary><b>Agent instructions</b></summary>
<!-- agent:start -->

Run `/slice S3`.

- **Scope and criteria:** `design/30-slices.md` § S3 @ `a1b2c3d`
- **Signatures:** `design/20-contract.md`
- **Out of scope here:** redrive (S7), telemetry (S8)

Stop conditions and procedure: `.claude/commands/slice.md`. Not restated here.
<!-- agent:end -->
</details>
```

Four properties make this work, and each is load-bearing:

- **The narrative is `Delivers:` verbatim.** Never invent prose for it. If it reads badly, that is a `/slices` defect — fix the doc, where the slice set is reviewed, and re-run.
- **The block is fenced.** `<!-- agent:start -->` and `<!-- agent:end -->` are a boundary, not a request. Everything between them is regenerable; everything outside is human-owned and never touched.
- **The block is thin.** Only what is specific to this issue: which slice, where authority lives, this slice's out-of-scope. **Generic stop conditions stay in `.claude/commands/slice.md`.** Copying them here would freeze a stale copy into every issue, and this command cannot edit issues to fix them.
- **Authority is pinned to a commit.** `§ S3 @ <sha>` is the sha of the last commit touching `design/30-slices.md`. It tells a reader whether the doc moved since the issue was written.

The rules this shape obeys — human-first, agent block is not a copy, never rewrite a checkbox — are stated in `AGENTS.md`, *Tracking work*. This section is the format; that one is why.

## What syncs

### Slices → issues

For each `## S<n> — <name>` in `design/30-slices.md`:

- Search existing issues, **open and closed**, for a title beginning `S<n> —`. A closed issue means the slice is done — do not reopen it and do not open a second one.
- If none exists, open one in the shape above. `Delivers:` becomes the narrative; `Acceptance:` becomes the `Done when` checkboxes, ids included; `Out of scope:` goes in the agent block.
- If one exists, **compare criterion ids, not prose.** Read `S<n>.<m>` from the issue's checkboxes and from the slice's `Acceptance:` lines:
  - **Ids match** — nothing to report, even if the wording differs. Reworded criteria are the common case and are not drift.
  - **An id is in the doc but not the issue** — a criterion was added after the issue was opened. Report it.
  - **An id is in the issue but not the doc** — a criterion was removed or, worse, renumbered. Report it and say which; a renumber means an existing checkbox now refers to something else.
- **Change nothing on a mismatch** — not the issue, not the doc. Which side is wrong is the user's call.
- **Never rewrite anything outside the `<!-- agent:start -->` … `<!-- agent:end -->` fence.** A ticked checkbox is progress someone recorded and an edited narrative is someone's deliberate wording. Inside the fence, regenerating is safe and is how a stale commit pin gets refreshed.
- **An open issue with every `Done when` box ticked gets closed.** Ticking is now itself a trusted signal (`AGENTS.md`, *Tracking work*) — `/slice` only ticks a box in the same run it confirms the criterion by id, so a fully-ticked issue has already had every criterion reported met. Say which issue and that you closed it. An issue with any box unticked is not closed, regardless of how old it is.

`design/30-slices.md` stays authoritative for what a slice *is*. The issue tracks whether it is *done*.

### Open items → issues

For each bullet under `## Open` in `design/90-decisions.md`:

- Title from the bolded lead sentence. The bullet's own prose is already human-readable — it becomes the narrative unchanged.
- `Done when` is whatever closing the item would require. If the item is a question rather than a task, the single criterion is that the question is answered and the answer recorded.
- The agent block carries: **Authority** — this issue, since the bullet no longer lives in `90-decisions.md`; and **Stop if** it turns out to need a contract or schema change.
- Match on title to avoid duplicates.
- After opening the issue, **remove the bullet from `## Open`** and say you did. That section exists so items do not rot; once an item is tracked, leaving it in both places is the duplication this kit's contract forbids.
- An item that is a *decision* rather than a *todo* does not belong in an issue. Leave it and say why.

### Milestone

`$1` names the milestone; with no argument, do not invent one — ask.

**Creating a milestone is carved out of the authorization rule**, the same as an issue (`AGENTS.md`, *Tracking work*). Create it and attach the issues named, and say what you did. Deleting one is not carved out.

## Bugs and stories are not synced

`/track` only syncs *from* `design/`. A **bug** has no upstream document — the issue is its origin — and a **story** that is not a slice of an existing design has none either. Both are filed by hand from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, which carries the same narrative-then-agent-block shape pre-filled.

**Do not open bug or story issues from this command**, and do not treat one you find as drift. If work you were asked to track is really a bug, say so and point at the template rather than inventing a slice for it.

## Labels

Use `slice` and `open` if they exist. Create them if missing — say that you did. Do not invent a wider taxonomy; `bug` and `enhancement` come from the issue templates, not from here.

## Projects

The convention is **one project per repository, named after it**.

- Look for a project whose title matches this repository's name. If one exists, **add every issue you opened to it** and say so.
- If none exists, **create one named after the repository and add every issue you opened.** This is carved out of the authorization rule the same as an issue or a milestone (`AGENTS.md`, *Tracking work*) — say that you created it. It will be bare: no custom columns, fields, or views, since board structure is a design choice this command gets generically wrong. Note that plainly rather than dressing it up.
- Never remove an issue from a project, change its status field, reorder a board, or delete a project. Creating one and adding to it are the only project writes.

GitHub Projects v2 needs the `project` token scope, which `repo` does not include. If `gh project list --owner <owner>` fails on scope, **say so and continue with issues and milestones** — a missing board is not a reason to abandon the sync. The fix is the user running `gh auth refresh -s project` in an interactive terminal; you cannot complete an OAuth flow.

## Report

- Issues opened, with numbers and titles
- Issues that already existed, skipped
- Issues closed, with numbers and titles
- Slices whose criteria drifted from their issue
- Open items removed from `90-decisions.md`
- Whether a matching project was found or created, and what was added to it
- Anything skipped, and why

**Then ask.** Drift between a slice and its issue is a reconciliation, and **a reconciliation ends in a decision, not a report** (`AGENTS.md`, *Working with me*). For each mismatch, put the resolution to the user with a recommendation — amend the doc, amend the issue, or accept the difference — and say what each costs. Report a clean run as clean; do not invent a question to close on.

## Never

- Close an issue that is not fully ticked. A ticked box is the only doneness signal this command trusts; the working tree, the commit log, and code that looks finished are not.
- Write to a repository the user does not own — the one boundary the carve-outs in `AGENTS.md`, *Tracking work* do not relax.
- Delete a milestone, a project, or a label.
